This bbs mobile application is properly running OK at least on android 10, as it runned on my vivo phone. However, the installation is blocked on newest mobile phone due to its ionic framework is relatively older. 
It could be used to query topics, images inside or across users groups, and it provides good view for query single user topics. 
This software is lack of good support of image view, as it can only simply display picture, and the recommended image plugin ngx-lightbox does not make effect in my practice.
Besides the image limit, it should be considered to be a stable version that could be running in some android and ios. 

The server side app is developed in django framework at https://github.com/ybtianyu/bbsserver.git
